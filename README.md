# Decision Simulator

This Python program simulates a person's decision-making process over their lifetime. The program assumes that the person has to make 5 decisions per day, with 5 right decisions and 5 wrong decisions to choose from. The program calculates the total number of decisions the person will make in their lifetime based on this rate, and assumes an equal probability of making right and wrong decisions. The program then simulates the decision-making process and determines at which age the person will surpass the number of right decisions they make compared to wrong decisions. Finally, the program prints the age at which this occurs and the number of right and wrong decisions the person has made up to that point.

## Requirements

This program requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system. There are no additional requirements or dependencies.

## Usage

To run the program, simply run the `main.py` file with Python:

```
main.py
```

The program will output the age at which the person surpasses the number of right decisions they make compared to wrong decisions, and the number of right and wrong decisions the person has made up to that point.
